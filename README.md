## Installation

To use this navigation menu in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Include the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your project.

```html
<!-- Add this to your HTML file -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

3. Copy the HTML structure from the provided `index.html` file and paste it into your own HTML file where you want the navigation menu to appear.

4. Customize the menu items by editing the `<ul>` element inside the navigation menu.

## Usage

The navigation menu is easy to use and can be integrated into any HTML-based project. Here's how to get started:

1. Include the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your project as described in the installation section.

2. Customize the menu items by editing the HTML structure inside the `<ul>` element within your HTML file.

```html
<nav class="navbar">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#section1">Section 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section2">Section 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section3">Section 3</a></li>
    <!-- Add or remove menu items as needed -->
  </ul>
</nav>
```

3. Customize the styles in the `style.css` file to match your project's design.

4. Customize the JavaScript behavior in the `script.js` file to suit your preferences, such as changing the scroll trigger point or the colors used for the menu.

## Customization

- **Menu Items:** Add or remove menu items by editing the HTML structure within the `<ul>` element in your HTML file.

- **Styling:** Adjust the styles (colors, fonts, sizes, etc.) in the `style.css` file to match your project's design.
